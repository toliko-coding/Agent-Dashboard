//   - An unarmed session (mayHoldLocked) or a malformed/incomplete payload is
//     never held at all. Nothing was evaluated, so there is nothing to fail
//     open or closed -- it is left entirely to Claude Code's own native
//     prompt, exactly as if the hook were not installed.
//   - A call the user's own deny rules forbid (deniedBy) IS actively vetoed:
//     it is held and offered without an Allow, and resolve refuses to turn it
//     into one even if asked (errDeniedByRule). That is the one guarantee
